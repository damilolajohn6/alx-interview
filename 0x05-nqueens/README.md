N Queens Puzzle Solver

The N Queens Puzzle is a classic chessboard problem that challenges you to place N non-attacking queens on an NÃ—N chessboard. This Python program provides a solution to the N Queens Puzzle, allowing you to find all possible solutions for a given N.
Usage

To use this program, follow these instructions:

    Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

    Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the program is located.

    Run the program with the following command, replacing N with the desired value (an integer greater or equal to 4):

    bash

python nqueens.py N

For example, to find solutions for an 8x8 chessboard:

bash

    python nqueens.py 8

    The program will print all the possible solutions to the N Queens Puzzle, one solution per line.

Program Details

    The program is implemented in Python and uses a backtracking algorithm to find all valid solutions.

    It performs input validation to ensure that N is a valid integer greater or equal to 4.

    The solutions are printed in the format [[row, col], [row, col], ...], where each pair [row, col] represents the position of a queen on the chessboard.

Example Output

Here's an example of the program's output for N = 4:

lua

[[0, 1], [1, 3], [2, 0], [3, 2]]
[[0, 2], [1, 0], [2, 3], [3, 1]]
